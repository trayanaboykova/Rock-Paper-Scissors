## Overview
"Rock-Paper-Scissors" is a simple console-based game developed in Java. The player competes against the computer, which randomly selects a move. The player can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the game determines the outcome based on the classic rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

## Features
- **Randomized Computer Choice:** The computer randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors for each round.
- **User Input:** The player can choose their move by entering 'r' for Rock, 'p' for Paper, or 's' for Scissors.
- **Outcome Display:** The game displays the choices made by both the player and the computer, and announces whether the player won, lost, or tied.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game:** Run the Java program. The game will prompt you to enter a choice.
2. **Choose Your Move:** Type 'r' for Rock, 'p' for Paper, or 's' for Scissors and press Enter.
3. **View the Outcome:** The game will display the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the result:
   - **You win!**: If the player's move beats the computer's move.
   - **You lose!**: If the computer's move beats the player's move.
   - **It's a tie!**: If both the player and the computer choose the same move.

## Installation and Setup
To play the game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone or download the repository containing the project files.
2. **Compile the Java File:** Use a Java compiler to compile the RockPaperScissors.java` file.
   ```sh
   javac RockPaperScissors.java

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A console or terminal to run the Java program

## Project Structure
- `RockPaperScissors.java`: The main Java file containing the game's logic.

## Learning Objectives
This project is part of a Java Fundamentals course designed to teach the following concepts:

- Basic Java syntax and structure
- Console input and output handling
- Random number generation
- Control structures (loops and conditionals)
- Handling user input and implementing basic game logic

## Future Improvements
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Adding a scoring system to keep track of wins, losses, and ties
- Introducing different modes or levels of difficulty
